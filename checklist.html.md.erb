owner: Ops Manager
---

This topic serves as a checklist for preparing to upgrade Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) from v2.2 to v2.3.

This topic contains important preparation steps that you must follow before beginning your upgrade. Failure to follow these instructions may jeopardize your existing deployment data and cause the upgrade to fail.

After completing the steps in this topic, you can continue to [Upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry](../customizing/upgrading-pcf.html).

## <a id="back-up-your-pcf-deployment"></a> Back Up your PCF Deployment 

Pivotal recommends backing up your PCF deployment before upgrading, to restore in the case of failure. To do this, follow the instructions in the [Backing Up Pivotal Cloud Foundry with BBR](././backup-restore/backup-pcf-bbr.html) topic.

## <a id="tiles-addons"></a> Update Tiles and Add-ons

The following section describes changes you must make to your product tiles and add-ons before upgrading PCF. 

### <a id="compatibility"></a> Review Tile Compatibility
 
Before you upgrade to PCF v2.3, please check whether the service tiles that you currently have deployed on PCF v2.2 are compatible with PCF v2.3.

To check PCF versions supported by a service tile, either from Pivotal or a Pivotal partner:

* Navigate to the tile's download page on [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io).
* Select the tile version in the **Releases** dropdown.
* See the **Depends On** section under **Release Details**. For more information, refer to the tile's release notes.

If the currently-deployed version of a tile is not compatible with PCF v2.3, you must upgrade the tile to a compatible version before you upgrade PCF. You do not need to upgrade tiles that are compatible with both PCF v2.2 and v2.3. 

<p class="note breaking"><strong>Warning: </strong>Some tiles released with PCF v2.3 require a new Xenial stemcell. Before deploying tiles that use Xenial, you must update any BOSH add-ons used in your deployment to include Xenial stemcells and add a Xenial stemcell to your stemcell library in Ops Manager. For more information, see <a href="../customizing/upgrading-pcf.html#stemcell-compat">Check OS Compatibility of BOSH-Managed Add-Ons and Tiles</a>.</p>

<p class="note breaking"><strong>Warning: </strong>PCF v2.3 does not yet have a compatible Pivotal Cloud Cache (PCC) tile.</p>

Some partner service tiles may be incompatible with PCF v2.3. Pivotal works with partners to ensure their tiles are updated to work with the latest versions of PCF. For more information about which partner service release compatibility, review the **Depends On** section of the partners tile download page, the partners services release documentation in [Pivotal Documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io), or contact the partner organization that produces the service tile.

The [Product Compatibility Matrix](
http://docs.pivotal.io/resources/product-compatibility-matrix.pdf) provides an overview of which PCF versions support which versions of the most popular service tiles from Pivotal.

### <a id="upgrade-service-tiles"></a> Upgrade Services Tiles

Upgrade all service tiles to versions compatible with PCF v2.3.
Review the <a href="http://docs.pivotal.io/resources/product-compatibility-matrix.pdf">Compatibility Matrix</a> and tile documentation to check version compatibility.

### <a id='bosh-director'></a> Configure BOSH Director 

With each release of a new PCF version, BOSH Director may require specific updates before upgrading to the new version. See the following sections for what action to take before upgrading to PCF v2.3:

1. If not already disabled, disable the VM Resurrector:
   1. From your **Installation Dashboard**, select the **BOSH Director** tile.
    1. Click **Director Config**.
    1. Clear the **Enable VM resurrector plugin** checkbox.
    1. Click **Save**.
    1. Return to the **Installation Dashboard**.
    1. Click **Review Pending Changes**, then **Apply Changes**.

1. If you disabled BOSH DNS, reenable it. In the **Director Config** pane of the **BOSH Director** tile, clear the **Disable BOSH DNS server for troubleshooting purposes** checkbox.

1. Check the required machine specifications for Ops Manager v2.3. These specifications are specific to your IaaS. If these specifications do not match your existing Ops Manager, modify the values of your Ops Manager VM instance. For example, if the boot disk of your existing Ops Manager is 50&nbsp;GB and the new Ops Manager requires 100&nbsp;GB, then increase the size of your Ops Manager boot disk to 100&nbsp;GB.


### <a id='patch'></a> Configure PAS 

With each release of a new PCF version, PAS may require specific updates before upgrading to the new version. See the following sections for what action to take before upgrading to PCF v2.3:

#### Install PAS v2.2.4 or Later

In PAS v2.3, traffic between the Gorouter and Cloud Controller is encrypted. To prevent app downtime while upgrading from v2.2 to v2.3, you must be running PAS v2.2.4 or later. These versions of PAS v2.2 contain the configuration `router.backends.enable_tls: true` in the Gorouter manifest.

#### <a id="groot"></a> Enable GrootFS

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If GrootFS is already enabled for your deployment, you can skip this step.</p>

You must enable GrootFS in your PAS v2.2 tile before upgrading to PAS v2.3. PAS v2.3 uses GrootFS as the only Garden image plugin and removes the checkbox to enable or disable GrootFS in the **Configure Application Containers** pane. For more information, see [Remove Deprecated Garden Image Plugin Option](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/pcf-release-notes/runtime-rn.html#groot) in the PAS v2.3 release notes.

To enable GrootFS, do the following:

1. Go to **Application Containers** in PAS.

1. Select **Enable the GrootFS container image plugin for Garden RunC**.

1. Click **Save**.

1. Go to **Director Config** in the BOSH Director tile.

1. Select **Recreate all VMs**.

1. Click **Save**.

1. Return to the Installation Dashboard.

1. Click **Review Pending Changes**, then **Apply Changes**.

Once you have enabled GrootFS, ensure the apps running on your deployment
function properly before proceeding with your upgrade. Any issues you experience
are most likely to appear directly following the deployment of PAS.

### <a id="disable-unused-errands"></a> Disable Unused Errands

To save upgrade time, you can disable unused PAS post-deploy errands. See the <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/2-3/tile-errands.html#post-deploy">Post-Deploy Errands</a> section of the Errands topic for details.
Only disable these errands if your environment does not need them.

In some cases, if you have previously disabled lifecycle errands for any installed product to reduce deployment time, you may want to re-enable these errands before upgrading. For more information, see the [Adding and Deleting Products](./add-delete.html#add-import) topic.

### <a id="stemcell-compat"></a> Check OS Compatibility of BOSH-Managed Add-Ons and Tiles

Some tiles released with PCF v2.3 require stemcells based on the Xenial OS rather than the older Trusty line. Before deploying tiles that use Xenial, you must:

- Update any BOSH add-ons used in your deployment so that they include both Trusty and Xenial stemcells. To do this, follow the [Update Manifests for BOSH-Managed Add-Ons](#add-on-manifest) directions below.
- For tiles that require Xenial, manually download and import a new Xenial stemcell into the <b>Ops Manager Stemcell Library</b>. See the [Tile Patch Releases Use Xenial Stemcells](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/pcf-release-notes/breaking-changes.html#xenial) note for details.

### <a id="add-on-manifest"></a> Update Manifests for BOSH-Managed Add-Ons

Before upgrading to PCF v2.3, operators who have deployed any PCF add-ons such as **IPsec for PCF**, **ClamAV for PCF**, or **File Integrity Monitoring for PCF** and who have deployed or are planning to deploy [Pivotal Application Service for Windows](../windows/index.html) must modify the add-on manifest to specify a compatible OS stemcell.

For example, **File Integrity Monitor for PCF** (FIM) is not supported on Windows. Therefore, the manifest must use an `include` directive to specify the target OS stemcell of `ubuntu-trusty` and `ubuntu-xenial`.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> To upgrade to a Xenial stemcell, see the documentation for each add-on and follow the instructions.</p>

To update an add-on manifest, do the following:

1. Locate your existing add-on manifest file. For example, for FIM, locate the `fim.yml` you uploaded to the Ops Manager VM.

1. Modify the manifest to include following `include` directive to your manifest:

    ```yml
      include:
        stemcell:
          - os: ubuntu-trusty
          - os: ubuntu-xenial
    ```
1. Upload the modified manifest file to your PCF deployment. For example instructions, see [Create the FIM Manifest](https://docs.pivotal.io/addon-fim/index.html#create-mfest).

If you use any other BOSH-managed add-ons in your deployment, you should verify OS compatibility for those component as well. For more information about configuring BOSH add-on manifests, see the [BOSH documentation](https://bosh.io/docs/runtime-config.html#addons).

### <a id="update-clamav-runtime"></a> Update Runtime Config of ClamAV

If you are using **ClamAV for PCF**, you must update your runtime config before upgrading to Pivotal Application Service for Windows (PASW) v2.3.

If you upgrade to PASW v2.3 without first updating the runtime config, then your Windows VMs will not be protected by ClamAV.

For more information about how to update your runtime config, see [Updating ClamAV Add-on for PCF to Run with PAS for Windows v2.3](https://docs.pivotal.io/addon-antivirus/1-4/updating-for-pasw.html) in the ClamAV documentation.

### <a id="azure-blobstore-addon"></a> Check External Blobstore Backup and Restore Add-On

If you have enabled external blobstore backups for an Azure Blobstore using the [Azure Backup Add-On](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-2/customizing/backup-restore/enabling-external-blobstore-backups.html#azure), you need to update your runtime configuration to remove the `sdk-preview` add-on before upgrading to PCF v2.3. If you do not remove this job, upgrading PAS fails with the error:

<pre>
Preparing deployment: Preparing deployment (00:00:01)
  L Error: Colocated job 'azure-blobstore-backup-restorer' is already added to the instance group 'backup-restore'.
</pre>

After removing this job from your runtime configuration, ensure that the **Enable backup and restore** checkbox is enabled in the PAS tile > **File Storage** pane. See [External Azure Storage](azure-er-config-terraform.html#external_azure) for instructions. 

## <a id="cert-expiry"></a> Check Certificate Authority Expiration Dates

Depending on the requirements of your deployment, you may need to rotate your Certificate Authority (CA) certificates. The non-configurable certificates in your deployment expire every two years. You must regenerate and rotate them so that critical components do not face a complete outage.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> PCF uses SHA-2 certificates and hashes by default. You can convert existing SHA-1 hashes into SHA-2 hashes by rotating your Ops Manager certificates using the procedure described in the <a href="../security/pcf-infrastructure/api-cert-rotation.html#rotate-saml-ca">Regenerating and Rotating Non-Configurable TLS/SSL Certificates</a> section of <em>Managing TLS Certificates</em>.</p>

To retrieve information about all the RSA and CA certificates for the BOSH Director and other products in your deployment, you can use the `GET /api/v0/deployed/certificates?expires_within=TIME` request of the Ops Manager API.

In this request, the `expires_within` parameter is optional. Valid values for the parameter are `d` for days, `w` for weeks, `m` for months, and `y` for years. For example, to search for certificates expiring within one month, replace `TIME` with `1m`:

<pre class="terminal">$ curl "https://OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/deployed/certificates?expires_within=1m" \
 -X GET \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA_ACCESS_TOKEN"
</pre>

For information about regenerating and rotateing CA certificates, see [Managing TLS Certificates](../security/pcf-infrastructure/api-cert-rotation.html).

## <a id="capacity"></a> Check the Capacity of your Deployment

The following sections describe steps for ensuring your deployment has adequate capacity to perform the upgrade.

### <a id="confirm-om-disk"></a> Confirm Adequate Disk Space

<%= partial 'check_disk_before_upgrade' %>

### <a id="check-diego-cell-ram-and-disk"></a> Check Diego Cell RAM and Disk

Check that Diego cells have sufficient available RAM and disk capacity to support app containers.

The KPIs that monitor these these resources are are:

* <code>rep.CapacityRemainingMemory</code>
* <code>rep.CapacityRemainingDisk</code>

### <a id="adjust-diego-cell-limits"></a> Adjust Diego Cell Limits 

If needed, adjust the maximum number of Diego cells that the platform can upgrade simultaneously, to avoid overloading the other cells. See <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/adminguide/diego-cell-upgrade.html">Managing Diego Cell Limits During Upgrade</a>.

For PCF v1.10 and later, the maximum number of cells that can update at once, <code>max_in_flight</code> is 4%. This setting is configured in the BOSH manifest's Diego cell definition. See the <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/adminguide/diego-cell-upgrade.html#limitations-considerations">Preventing Overload</a> section for details.

Review the <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/monitoring/kpi.html#cell">Diego Cell Metrics</a> section of the KPI topic for more information about these KPIs.

### <a id="storage"></a> Review File Storage IOPS and Other Upgrade Limiting Factors

During the PCF upgrade process, a large quantity of data is moved around on disk.

To ensure a successful upgrade of PCF, verify that your underlying PAS file storage is performant enough to handle the upgrade. For more information about the configurations to evaluate, see [Upgrade Considerations for Selecting Pivotal Cloud Foundry Storage](../opsguide/storage_considerations.html).

In addition to file storage IOPS, consider additional existing deployment factors that can impact overall upgrade duration and performance:

|**Factor**|**Impact**|
|----------|----------|
|**Network latency**| Network latency can contribute to how long it takes to move app instance data to new containers. |
|**Number of ASGs**| A large number of [Application Security Groups](../concepts/asg.html) in your deployment can contribute to an increase in app instance container startup time. |
|**Number of app instances and application growth**| A large increase in the number of app instances and average droplet size since the initial deployment can increase the upgrade impact on your system. |

To review example upgrade-related performance measurements of an existing production Cloud Foundry deployment, see the [Pivotal Web Services Performance During Upgrade](../opsguide/pws_upgrade_load.html) topic.

### <a id="bosh-clean-up"></a> Run BOSH clean-up 

Run <code>bosh -e ALIAS clean-up --all</code> to clean up old stemcells, releases, orphaned disks, and other resources before upgrade.
This cleanup helps prevent the product and stemcell upload process from exceeding the BOSH Director's available persistent disk space.

## <a id="health"></a> Check the Health of your Deployment

The following sections describe steps for ensuring your deployment is healthy before you perform the upgrade.

### <a id="collect-foundation-health-status"></a> Collect Foundation Health Status 

Run and collect foundation health status in at least one of the following ways:

* If your PCF deployment has external metrics monitoring set up, verify that VM CPU, RAM, and disk use levels are within reasonable levels.
* Run BOSH CLI commands to check system status:
	* <code>bosh -e ALIAS -d DEPLOYMENT_NAME instances --ps</code>. <p><code>bosh instances</code> with the flags <code>--ps</code>,  <code>--vitals</code>, or <code>--failing</code>highlights individual job failure.</p> 
	* <code>bosh -e ALIAS vms --vitals</code>. This reveals VMs with high CPU, high memory, high disk utilization, and with <code>state</code> != <code>running</code>.</p>
	* <code>bosh -e ALIAS -d DEPLOYMENT_NAME cck --report</code>
* Check Ops Manager GUI each PAS/Tiles the status page for CPU/RAM/DISK utilization
* Validate Ops Manager persistent disk usage is below 50%. If not, follow Prep 6 in the <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/customizing/upgrading-pcf.html#prepare-env">Ops Manager upgrade docs</a>.

(Optional) Check the logs for errors before proceeding with the upgrade. For more information, see [Viewing Logs in the Command Line Interface](../devguide/deploy-apps/streaming-logs.html#view).

### <a id="push-test-app"></a> Push and Scale a Test App

Check that a test app can be pushed and scaled horizontally, manually or via automated testing.
This check ensures that the platform supports apps as expected before the upgrade.

### <a id="validate-mysql-cluster-health"></a> Validate MySQL Cluster Health

If you are running Elastic Runtime MySQL as a cluster, run the <code>mysql-diag</code> tool to validate health of the cluster.

See the BOSH CLI v2 instructions in the <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/pas/mysql-diag.html">Running mysql-diag</a> topic.

### <a id="check-health"></a> Review Pending and Recent Changes 

1. Confirm there are no outstanding changes in Ops Manager or any other tile. All tiles should be **green**. Click **Review Pending Changes**, then **Apply Changes** if necessary.

1. After applying changes, click **Recent Install Logs** to confirm that the changes completed cleanly:
    <pre>
    Cleanup complete
    {"type": "step\_finished", "id": "clean\_up\_bosh.cleaning\_up"}
    Exited with 0.
    </pre>   

## <a id="export"></a> Export Your Installation

To export your installation, do the following:

1. In your Ops Manager v2.2 **Installation Dashboard**, click the account dropdown and select **Settings**.

    <%= image_tag("./images/upgrade_to_1.9.png") %>

1. On the **Settings** screen, select **Export Installation Settings** from the left menu, then click **Export Installation Settings**.

    <%= image_tag("./images/export_install_settings.png") %>

This exports the current PCF installation with all of its assets.

When you export an installation, the export contains the base VM images, necessary packages, and configuration settings, but does not include releases between upgrades if Ops Manager has already uploaded them to BOSH. When backing up PCF, you must take this into account by backing up the BOSH blobstore that contains the uploaded releases. BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR) backs up the BOSH blobstore. For more information, see [Backing Up Pivotal Cloud Foundry with BBR](./backup-restore/backup-pcf-bbr.html).

* The export time depends on the size of the exported file.
* Some browsers do not provide feedback on the status of the export process and might appear to hang.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Some operating systems automatically unzip the exported installation. If this occurs, create a ZIP file of the unzipped export. Do not start compressing at the "installation" folder level. Instead, start compressing at the level containing the <code>config.yml</code> file:</p>

<%= image_tag("./images/compress.png") %>

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> If you fail to perform the remedial steps for this issue, this upgrade process may corrupt your existing usage data.</p>
