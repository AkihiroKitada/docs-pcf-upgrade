title: Upgrade Checklist for PCF v2.1
owner: Ops Manager
---

This topic serves as a checklist for upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) from v2.0 to v2.1.

## <a id="compatibility"></a>Tile Compatibility

Before you upgrade to PCF v2.1, please check whether PCF v2.1 supports the service tile versions that you currently have deployed.

The [Product Compatibility Matrix](
http://docs.pivotal.io/resources/product-compatibility-matrix.pdf) provides an overview of which PCF versions support which versions of the most popular service tiles from Pivotal.

To check PCF version support for any service tile, from Pivotal or a Pivotal partner:

* Navigate to the tile's download page on [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io).
* Select the tile version in the **Releases** dropdown.
* See the **Depends On** section under **Release Details**. For more information, refer to the tile's release notes.

If the currently-deployed version of a tile is not compatible with PCF v2.1, you must upgrade the tile before you upgrade PCF. You do not need to upgrade tiles that are compatible with both PCF v2.0 and v2.1.

When you have completed your upgrade please take some time to complete [this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScf9KuTbF3B9CjldMGqQxF-GA72xMR0DGzaGmhX4uWMrD8pOA/viewform?c=0&w=1).

## <a id="env"></a>Environment Details

Pivotal provides the empty table below as a model to print out or adapt for recording and tracking the tile versions that you have deployed in all of your environments.

## <a id="breaking"></a>PCF 2.1 Breaking Changes 

PCF 2.1 has the following breaking changes. For more information, see [PCF v2.1 Breaking Changes](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-1/pcf-release-notes/breaking-changes.html) in the PCF Release Notes.

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th><strong>Breaking Change</strong></th>
<th><strong>Details</strong></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ops Manager removed IP address management</td>
<td><p>Prior to v2.1, Ops Manager allocated and assigned IP addresses manually in the deployment manifest. This caused deployment failures when Ops Manager and the BOSH Director had mismatches on their IP address assignments.</p>
<p>Ops Manager now delegates IP address management to the BOSH Director, which gives operators more flexibility and prevents deployment failures. For 2.1 compatibility, developers must change any service or app code that queries Ops Manager for IP addresses so that it instead retrieves the values from BOSH.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Removal of Automated Backup Configuration for Internal MySQL</td>
<td><p>The PAS tile <strong>Internal MySQL</strong> pane no longer includes the <strong>Automated Backups Configuration</strong> field. Pivotal recommends that operators use <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/backup-restore/index.html#bbr">BOSH Backup and Restore</a> to back up Internal MySQL components.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://discuss.pivotal.io/hc/en-us/articles/360001817593">Restore from PAS Automated Database Backup is Not Supported in 1.11 and later</a> in the KB.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Spring Cloud Services no longer stores binding credentials in environment variables.</td>
<td><p>Spring Cloud Services (SCS) 1.5.0 and later <a href="http://docs.pivotal.io/spring-cloud-services/tile-configuration.html#secure-service-instance-credentials-with-credhub">uses CredHub</a> to store binding credentials, rather than saving them in environment variables.</p>
<p>App developers must change any code that reads binding credentials from the environment so that it retrieves the values from CredHub instead. See the <a href="http://docs.pivotal.io/spring-cloud-services/1-5/release-notes.html#1-5-0">SCS 1.5.0 Release Notes</a> for details.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>When the Gorouter uses TLS to communicate with apps, it keeps app connections alive to prevent the performance impact from running TLS.</td>
<td>By default, each router instance maintains a max of 49 thousand open connections. A checkbox is available to disable this feature in the Ops Manager Director tile <strong>Networking</strong> pane, under <strong>Enable Keepalive Connections for Router</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>With the VMware NSX-T tile installed, updating a PCF deployment by clicking <strong>Apply Changes</strong> causes the BOSH agent to become unresponsive on all Diego cells. </td>
<td>To fix this problem, run the BOSH CLI command <code>bosh cck</code> ("<a href="https://bosh.io/docs/cck/">cloud check</a>") after the redeployment completes. This command recreates Diego cell VMs, rebooting their BOSH agents and restoring their responsiveness. </td>
