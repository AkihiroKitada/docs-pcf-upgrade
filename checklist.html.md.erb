title: Upgrade Preparation Checklist for PCF v2.0
owner: Ops Manager
---

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Elastic Runtime has been renamed to Pivotal Application Service (PAS).</p>

This topic serves as a checklist for preparing to upgrade Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) from v1.12 to v2.0.

This topic contains important preparation steps that you must follow before beginning your upgrade. Failure to follow these instructions may jeopardize your existing deployment data and cause the upgrade to fail.

After completing the steps in this topic, you can continue to [Upgrading Pivotal Cloud Foundry](../customizing/upgrading-pcf.html).


## <a id="back-up-your-pcf-deployment"></a> Back Up Your PCF Deployment

Pivotal recommends backing up your PCF deployment before upgrading, to restore in the case of failure. To do this, follow the instructions in the [Backing Up Pivotal Cloud Foundry with BBR](../customizing/backup-restore/backup-pcf-bbr.html) topic.

## <a id="tiles-addons"></a> Update Tiles and Add-Ons

The following section describes changes you must make to your product tiles and add-ons before upgrading PCF.

### <a id="compatibility"></a> Review Tile Compatibility

Before you upgrade to PCF v2.0, please check whether the service tiles that you currently have deployed on PCF v1.12 are compatible with PCF v2.0.

To check PCF versions supported by a service tile, either from Pivotal or a Pivotal partner:

* Navigate to the tile's download page on [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io).
* Select the tile version in the **Releases** dropdown.
* See the **Depends On** section under **Release Details**. For more information, refer to the tile's release notes.

If the currently-deployed version of a tile is not compatible with PCF v2.0, you must upgrade the tile to a compatible version before you upgrade PCF. You do not need to upgrade tiles that are compatible with both PCF v1.12 and v2.0.

Some partner service tiles may be incompatible with PCF v2.0. Pivotal works with partners to ensure their tiles are updated to work with the latest versions of PCF. For more information about which partner service release compatibility, review the **Depends On** section of the partners tile download page, the partners services release documentation in [Pivotal Documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io), or contact the partner organization that produces the service tile.

The [Product Compatibility Matrix](http://docs.pivotal.io/resources/product-compatibility-matrix.pdf) provides an overview of which PCF versions support which versions of the most popular service tiles from Pivotal.

### <a id="upgrade-service-tiles"></a> Upgrade Services Tiles

Upgrade all service tiles to versions that are compatible with PCF v2.0. Service tiles are add-on products you install alongside your runtime. For example, MySQL for PCF, PCF Healthwatch, and RabbitMQ are service tiles.

Do not upgrade runtime tiles, such as PAS, PASW, or Pivotal Container Service (PKS), at this time.

Review the [Compatibility Matrix](http://docs.pivotal.io/resources/product-compatibility-matrix.pdf) and tile documentation to check version compatibility.

The following sections contain specific information about upgrading several service tiles.

#### <a id="upgrade-sso"></a> Upgrade SSO for PCF

<p class="note warning"><strong>Breaking Change:</strong> If you have the Single Sign-On (SSO) service tile installed, you must first upgrade the SSO tile to v1.5.3 and configure the Apps Manager errand before you can upgrade the PAS tile to v2.0. To properly upgrade your SSO tile, see <a href="https://discuss.pivotal.io/hc/en-us/articles/115015727408">Upgrade SSO Service Tile resource instance between PCF 1.12 and PCF 2.0</a> in the Pivotal Knowledge Base.</p>

#### <a id="upgrade-mysql"></a> Upgrade MySQL for PCF

If your PCF deployment includes both [PAS for Windows 2012R2](../windows2012r2/index.html) and **MySQL for PCF v1.x**, download and upgrade to MySQL for PCF v1.10.6 or later. For upgrade instructions, see the [MySQL for PCF](https://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/1-10/index.html) documentation.

#### <a id="upgrade-rmq"></a> Upgrade and Configure RabbitMQ for PCF

If your PCF deployment contains **RabbitMQ for PCF**, download and upgrade RabbitMQ for PCF to v1.11 or later. For upgrade instructions, see the [RabbitMQ for PCF](https://docs.pivotal.io/rabbitmq-cf/index.html) documentation. As part of the upgrade, ensure that the firewall rules on your Rabbit VM instances allow inbound traffic on port `8301`.

#### <a id="upgrade-redis"></a> Upgrade and Configure Redis for PCF

If your PCF deployment contains **Redis for PCF**, download and upgrade to Redis for PCF v1.10. Verify that you complete the following as part of the upgrade:

* Ensure that you set persistent disk to 3.5x the amount of RAM for your Dedicated-VM Redis instances. See [Networks, Security, and Assigning AZs](https://docs.pivotal.io/redis/installing.html#azs) for more information.
* Ensure that you have configured appropriate firewall rules for your Redis VM instances. See [Required Networking Rules for On-Demand Services](https://docs.pivotal.io/redis/1-10/odnetworking.html#network-rules) for more information.

For upgrade instructions, see the [Redis for PCF](https://docs.pivotal.io/redis/1-11/index.html) documentation.

### <a id='bosh-director'></a> Configure BOSH Director

With each release of a new PCF version, BOSH Director may require specific updates before upgrading to the new version. See the following sections for what action to take before upgrading to PCF v2.0:

1. If not already disabled, disable the VM Resurrector:
   1. From your **Installation Dashboard**, select the **BOSH Director** tile.
    1. Click **Director Config**.
    1. Clear the **Enable VM resurrector plugin** checkbox.
    1. Click **Save**.
    1. Return to the **Installation Dashboard**.
    1. Click **Apply Changes**.

1. If you disabled BOSH DNS, reenable it. In the **Director Config** pane of the **BOSH Director** tile, clear the **Disable BOSH DNS server for troubleshooting purposes** checkbox.

1. Check the required machine specifications for Ops Manager v2.0. These specifications are specific to your IaaS. If these specifications do not match your existing Ops Manager, modify the values of your Ops Manager VM instance. For example, if the boot disk of your existing Ops Manager is 50&nbsp;GB and the new Ops Manager requires 100&nbsp;GB, then increase the size of your Ops Manager boot disk to 100&nbsp;GB.

### <a id="disable-unused-errands"></a> Disable Unused Errands

To save upgrade time, you can disable unused PAS post-deploy errands. See the [Post-Deploy Errands](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/2-0/tile-errands.html#post-deploy) section of the Errands topic for details. Only disable these errands if your environment does not need them.

In some cases, if you have previously disabled lifecycle errands for any installed product to reduce deployment time, you may want to re-enable these errands before upgrading. For more information, see the [Adding and Deleting Products](../customizing/add-delete.html#add-import) topic.

### <a id="upgrade-add-ons"></a> Check OS Compatibility of PCF and BOSH-Managed Add-Ons

If both the following conditions are true, you must modify the add-on manifest to specify a compatible OS stemcell before upgrading to PCF v2.0:

* You have deployed any PCF add-ons such as **ClamAV for PCF**, **IPsec for PCF**, or **File Integrity Monitoring for PCF**

* You have deployed or are planning to deploy [PAS for Windows 2012R2](../windows2012r2/index.html).

For example, if you deployed **ClamAV for PCF** and you plan to deploy PAS for Windows 2012R2, you must specify the target OS stemcell of `ubuntu-trusty` in the add-on manifest.

To update an add-on manifest, do the following:

1. Locate your existing add-on manifest file. For example, for ClamAV, locate the `clamav.yml` you uploaded to the Ops Manager VM.

1. Modify the manifest to include following `include` directive:

    ```yml
      include:
        stemcell:
          - os: ubuntu-trusty
    ```

1. Upload the manifest file to your PCF deployment. For example instructions, see [Create the ClamAV Manifest](https://docs.pivotal.io/addon-antivirus/index.html#create-mfest).

If you use any other BOSH-managed add-ons in your deployment, you should verify OS compatibility for those component as well. For more information about configuring BOSH add-on manifests, see the [BOSH documentation](https://bosh.io/docs/runtime-config.html#addons).

### <a id="azure-blobstore-addon"></a> Check Backup and Restore External Blobstore Add-On

If you have enabled external blobstore backups for an Azure Blobstore using the [Blobstore Add-On](../../customizing/backup-restore/enabling-external-blobstore-backups.html#azure), you need to update your runtime configuration to remove the `sdk-preview` add-on before upgrading to PCF v2.0. If you do not remove this job, upgrading PAS fails with the error:

<pre>
Preparing deployment: Preparing deployment (00:00:01)
  L Error: Colocated job 'azure-blobstore-backup-restorer' is already added to the instance group 'backup-restore'.
</pre>

After removing this job from your runtime configuration, ensure that the **Enable backup and restore** checkbox is enabled in the PAS tile > **File Storage** pane. See [External Azure Storage](../customizing/azure-er-config-terraform.html#external_azure) for instructions.


## <a id="cert-expiry"></a> Check Certificate Authority Expiration Dates

Depending on the requirements of your deployment, you may need to rotate your Certificate Authority (CA) certificates. The non-configurable certificates in your deployment expire every two years. You must regenerate and rotate them so that critical components do not face a complete outage.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> PCF uses SHA-2 certificates and hashes by default. You can convert existing SHA-1 hashes into SHA-2 hashes by rotating your Ops Manager certificates using the procedure described in the <a href="../security/pcf-infrastructure/api-cert-rotation.html#rotate-saml-ca">Regenerating and Rotating Non-Configurable TLS/SSL Certificates</a> section of <em>Managing TLS Certificates</em>.</p>

To retrieve information about all the RSA and CA certificates for the BOSH Director and other products in your deployment, you can use the `GET /api/v0/deployed/certificates?expires_within=TIME` request of the Ops Manager API.

In this request, the `expires_within` parameter is optional. Valid values for the parameter are `d` for days, `w` for weeks, `m` for months, and `y` for years. For example, to search for certificates expiring within one month, replace `TIME` with `1m`:

<pre class="terminal">$ curl "https://OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/deployed/certificates?expires_within=1m" \
 -X GET \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA_ACCESS_TOKEN"
</pre>

For information about regenerating and rotating CA certificates, see [Managing TLS Certificates](../security/pcf-infrastructure/api-cert-rotation.html).


## <a id="capacity"></a> Check the Capacity of Your Deployment

The following sections describe steps for ensuring your deployment has adequate capacity to perform the upgrade.

### <a id="confirm-om-disk"></a> Confirm Adequate Disk Space

<%= partial '../customizing/check_disk_before_upgrade' %>

### <a id="check-diego-cell-ram-and-disk"></a> Check Diego Cell RAM and Disk

Check that Diego cells have sufficient available RAM and disk capacity to support app containers.

The KPIs that monitor these these resources are are:

* `rep.CapacityRemainingMemory`
* `rep.CapacityRemainingDisk`

### <a id="adjust-diego-cell-limits"></a> Adjust Diego Cell Limits

If needed, adjust the maximum number of Diego cells that the platform can upgrade simultaneously, to avoid overloading the other cells. See [Managing Diego Cell Limits During Upgrade](./configuring.html#diego-cells).


For PCF v1.10 and later, the maximum number of cells that can update at once, `max_in_flight is 4%. This setting is configured in the BOSH manifest's Diego cell definition. See the [Preventing Overload](./configuring.html#diego-cells) section for details.

Review the [Diego Cell Metrics](../monitoring/kpi.html#cell) section of the KPI topic for more information about these KPIs.

### <a id="storage"></a> Review File Storage IOPS and Other Upgrade Limiting Factors

During the PCF upgrade process, a large quantity of data is moved around on disk.

To ensure a successful upgrade of PCF, verify that your underlying PAS file storage is performant enough to handle the upgrade. For more information about the configurations to evaluate, see [Upgrade Considerations for Selecting Pivotal Cloud Foundry Storage](../upgrading/configuring.html#file-storage).

In addition to file storage IOPS, consider additional existing deployment factors that can impact overall upgrade duration and performance:

|**Factor**|**Impact**|
|----------|----------|
|**Network latency**| Network latency can contribute to how long it takes to move app instance data to new containers. |
|**Number of ASGs**| A large number of [Application Security Groups](../concepts/asg.html) in your deployment can contribute to an increase in app instance container startup time. |
|**Number of app instances and application growth**| A large increase in the number of app instances and average droplet size since the initial deployment can increase the upgrade impact on your system. |

To review example upgrade-related performance measurements of an existing production Cloud Foundry deployment, see the [Pivotal Web Services Performance During Upgrade](../opsguide/pws_upgrade_load.html) topic.

### <a id="bosh-clean-up"></a> Run BOSH Clean-Up

Run `bosh -e ALIAS clean-up --all` to clean up old stemcells, releases, orphaned disks, and other resources before upgrade. This cleanup helps prevent the product and stemcell upload process from exceeding the BOSH Director's available persistent disk space.


## <a id="health"></a> Check the Health of Your Deployment

The following sections describe steps for ensuring your deployment is healthy before you perform the upgrade.

### <a id="collect-foundation-health-status"></a> Collect Foundation Health Status

Run and collect foundation health status in at least one of the following ways:

* If your PCF deployment has external metrics monitoring set up, verify that VM CPU, RAM, and disk use levels are within reasonable levels.
* Run BOSH CLI commands to check system status:
	* `bosh -e ALIAS -d DEPLOYMENT_NAME instances --ps`. <p>`bosh instances` with the flags `--ps`, `--vitals`, or `--failing` highlights individual job failure.</p>
	* `bosh -e ALIAS vms --vitals`. This reveals VMs with high CPU, high memory, high disk utilization, and with `state` != `running`.
	* `bosh -e ALIAS -d DEPLOYMENT_NAME cck --report`
* Check Ops Manager GUI each PAS/Tiles the status page for CPU/RAM/DISK utilization
* Validate Ops Manager persistent disk usage is below 50%. If not, follow Prep 6 in the [Ops Manager upgrade docs](../customizing/upgrading-pcf.html#prepare-env).

(Optional) Check the logs for errors before proceeding with the upgrade. For more information, see [Viewing Logs in the Command Line Interface](../devguide/deploy-apps/streaming-logs.html#view).

### <a id="push-test-app"></a> Push and Scale a Test App

Check that a test app can be pushed and scaled horizontally, manually or through automated testing. This check ensures that the platform supports apps as expected before the upgrade.

### <a id="validate-mysql-cluster-health"></a> Validate MySQL Cluster Health

If you are running PAS MySQL as a cluster, run the `mysql-diag` tool to validate health of the cluster.

See the BOSH CLI v2 instructions in the [Running mysql-diag](../pas/mysql-diag.html) topic.

### <a id="check-health"></a> Review Recent Changes

1. Confirm there are no outstanding changes in Ops Manager or any other tile. All tiles should be **green**. Click **Apply Changes** if necessary.

1. After applying changes, click **Recent Install Logs** to confirm that the changes completed cleanly:
    <pre>
    Cleanup complete
    {"type": "step\_finished", "id": "clean\_up\_bosh.cleaning\_up"}
    Exited with 0.
    </pre>


## <a id="export"></a> Export Your Installation

To export your installation, do the following:

1. In your Ops Manager v1.12 **Installation Dashboard**, click the account dropdown and select **Settings**.

    <%= image_tag("./images/upgrade_to_1.9.png") %>

1. On the **Settings** screen, select **Export Installation Settings** from the left menu, then click **Export Installation Settings**.

    <%= image_tag("./images/export_install_settings.png") %>

This exports the current PCF installation with all of its assets.

When you export an installation, the export contains the base VM images, necessary packages, and configuration settings, but does not include releases between upgrades if Ops Manager has already uploaded them to BOSH. When backing up PCF, you must take this into account by backing up the BOSH blobstore that contains the uploaded releases. BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR) backs up the BOSH blobstore. For more information, see [Backing Up Pivotal Cloud Foundry with BBR](../customizing/backup-restore/backup-pcf-bbr.html).

* The export time depends on the size of the exported file.
* Some browsers do not provide feedback on the status of the export process and might appear to hang.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Some operating systems automatically unzip the exported installation. If this occurs, create a ZIP file of the unzipped export. Do not start compressing at the "installation" folder level. Instead, start compressing at the level containing the <code>config.yml</code> file:</p>
